# Each row: mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution
# used to initialize the parameter given in the comment.  For the
# masses and semimajor axes of the companions, and for the jitter, the
# distributions used are lognormal.  In these cases the standard
# deviations are of the natural log about the distribution peak.  In
# all cases, realizations of the distributions that result in
# unphysical parameters or combinations of parameters will be
# automatically adjusted.

# Companion #2 (indexed as companion 1 in relative astrometry) [if you
# have a second companion, put its guesses below as for companion 1]
# The number of parameters given in this file *must* be a match to the
# number of companions that you specify in the configuration file.  It
# should have the same rows, with the same parameter descriptions, as
# for the first companion listed above.
